Hi, my name is Kaitlin Sloan. I am a Junior Computer Science major and am from the Nashville area. Some of my hobbies and interests include video games and working on and learning about Product Development. I am excited to take this course and work on a group project with my classmates to further develop my teamwork and communication skills. For my project, I am interested in either exploring a topic in the medical field or creating a video game of some kind.

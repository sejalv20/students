My name is Kenneth Hinman. I work full time managing Jesses Butcher Shop in Knoxville while attending classes full time at UTK. My hobbies include running, cycling, and I'm hoping to complete my first full marathon this year. My main interests are college football, predictive modeling, and finance, so for a class project I would like to do something involving making financial predictions for the stock market or statistical forecasting for a specific sport.
